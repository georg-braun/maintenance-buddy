# Maintenance buddy
*This project is still in development*

> Manage maintenances and get reminders about pending tasks. 
The history and notes of maintenances will simplify maintenances in the future and keep the machines running ;)

## Motivation

I own some bicycles and motorcycles which I maintain. In the past I used some excel sheets about the done maintenances. But I didn't saw what maintenances are pending. Therefore I started to create an application that helps me. In future the app shouldn't be limited to vehicles.


## Features and Roadmap

## Technologies and techniques

Used technologies:
- Backend (API)
  - ASP.NET Core
